# 🧑‍💼 Employee Management System (Java)

A **console-based Employee Management System** developed in **Core Java**, showcasing the same application implemented using **multiple data-handling approaches**.  
This project demonstrates a **progressive learning path**, starting from basic arrays and evolving to **Collections with File Handling for permanent data storage**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains **three different implementations** of the Employee Management System, each improving on the previous version by using more advanced Java concepts.

The goal of this project is to **understand data structures, collections, exception handling, and file persistence** through practical implementation.
